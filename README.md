# Quality_Control
In this report on quality control, I did a normality test: (P-Value) using minitab, also I wrote the solution and outputs method using Excel and the Minitab, for four lessons, which are:
- Control chart for variables (Xbar-R), case of n >1
- Control chart for variables (Xbar-S), case of n >1
- Control chart for variables (I-MR), case of n = 1
- Control chart for variables (I-MR) without data normality
